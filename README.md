For our contribution for this project, which is shown on this GitHub Repository, first of all, we work on different branches (develop-phong, develop-tuan). After that, when the code is fine with no error or problem in debugging, we push the branches and update on the "develop" branch.

At the end of the working process, when we finished with our demo, we pushed the final code from the "develop" branch to "main", which is displayed on the main page of this repository.
